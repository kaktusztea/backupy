Hi! 

Thanks for using backupy. v1.0 is pretty solid, but development does not stop.

The following features will come soon:
* HOME_CONFIG unique backup
* unique full-path-file exclusion (i.e exclude a certain, huge, unneeded file)
* reserve and move n previous backups to a different directory
* debug logfile
* [META] section - informations for the backup set
  description = "This is my set for weekly data backup"
  author = myuser
  creation_date = 2016-09-01
* filelist logfile creation about compressed filepathes
* pre-calculate estimated file size -> predict if free space will be enough or not

regards,
BÃ¡lint
